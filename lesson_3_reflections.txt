When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You can access the work in a remote repository from other computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may be working on a feature and don't want other features made by other
	people to interfere with it yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: when 2 people want 2 copies of a repository
	Clones: when you want 2 copies of a repository for yourself
	Branches: when you want to try out differences in code yourself

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
